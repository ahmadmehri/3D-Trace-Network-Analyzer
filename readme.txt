To install the application, launch the program file Traces_Network_Analyzer

If the installation does not start, it is advised to deactivate the Windows Security and try again to ensure a smooth installation process.

An internet connection is needed to download and install MATLAB Runtime R2023b.

It's recommended that the 3D model be used in the '00-Sample Data' folder to test the software after installation.

To run the analysis on your data, just so you know, for traces and points cloud with high accuracy, the algorithm will work very slowly! Then, it would be best for you to make your trace polylines and points cloud as simple as possible. The point cloud is only for surface referencing, so it could be a low-density points cloud.
